  mainDialogue:
  - (Brook quickly taps their hooves in a slightly annoying but mostly endearing
    fashion)

  - "I coulda sworn I had a pen ooh what about a magical pen that the heroes find
    in a mystical wagon oh write that d\u2014"
  - (Brook turns from you, lost in a mysterious world of their own creation, one
    that their school friends will surely enjoy too)
  exitDialogue:
  - "Oh! Here\u2019s my stop! Thank you so so much for my first tram ride of the
    school year! "
