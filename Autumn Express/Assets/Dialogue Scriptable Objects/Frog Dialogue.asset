  enterDialogue:
  - "*Ribbit* \u2014 Goodness! Deary, you\u2019ve arrived just in the nick of time!"
  - "My old bones were about to give out standing here! \rBut at last I can sit and
    *ribbit* rest my flippers.\r"
  - Onward to the pond, deary!
  mainDialogue:
  - "Oh goodness, my vision\u2019s not what it used to be... but those autumn colors
    outside are unmistakable! And oh-so delightful!"
  - "All that orange and yellow\u2026 And when I think about it, that's perhaps my
    favorite palette!"
  - ' The colors of nature when it decides to rest... which is something I *ribbit*
    ought to be doing at this age.'
  - But alas, I'm still out and about!
  - "In fact deary, the stop you're taking me to leads to a pond I\u2019ve been painting
    at for *ribbit*...oh heavens\u2014...for years!"
  - This time of year the pond is the most incredible sight...
  - "...and I figured this time I\u2019d make some new paintings for my dear grandkids!
    \n*ribbit*"
  - Despite them being a real pain in my tuckus from time to time... *ribbit intensifies*
  - "those little tadpoles have made me such a proud grandmother\u2026 which is why
    I want to paint them some gifts"
  - Even if I have to hobble these old bones down to the pond in order to paint them!
  - "But it\u2019s really no bother. It\u2019s a nice journey\u2026 and the tram
    you\u2019re driving for us makes it so much easier! *ribbit*"
  - "\u2014heavens! My allergies must be *ribbit* \u2014acting up. Excuse me, deary."
  exitDialogue:
  - Why thank you deary *ribbit*.
  - Let me paint you a little something to hang in this tram of yours. It's the least
    I could do to repay your *ribbit* kindness.
  missedStopDialogue:
  - "*ribbit*\u2014pardon me, deary, but I believe you've passed my pond *ribbit*"
  - "Not to worry. I\u2019ll just get off at the next stop. These old flippers could
    use some exercise. And a calm stroll can be nice!"
  nextStopDialogue:
  - Oh look, deary! *ribbit* I can see my pond coming up! The next stop should be
    mine.
