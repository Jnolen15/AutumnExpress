  - "*Ribbit* \u2014 Goodness! Deary, you\u2019ve arrived just in the nick of time!"
  - "My old bones were about to give out standing here! \rBut at last I can sit and
    *ribbit* rest my flippers.\r"
  - Onward to the pond, deary!
  mainDialogue:
  - "Oh goodness, my vision\u2019s not what it used to be... but those autumn colors
    outside are unmistakable! And oh-so delightful!"
  - "All that orange and yellow\u2026 And when I think about it, that's perhaps my
    favorite palette!"
  - ' The colors of nature when it decides to rest... which is something I *ribbit*
    ought to be doing at this age.'
  - But alas, I'm still out and about!
  - "In fact deary, the stop you're taking me to leads to a pond I\u2019ve been painting
    at for *ribbit*...oh heavens\u2014...for years!"
  - This time of year the pond is the most incredible sight...
  - "...and I figured this time I\u2019d make some new paintings for my dear grandkids!
    \n*intense ribbit*"

    tadpoles have made me such a proud grandmother
