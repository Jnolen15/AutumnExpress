  enterDialogue:
  - (Boots walks into the bus, and stumbles on the top step.)
  - (He catches himself while his cheeks turn red with embarrassment, gives you a
    half-glance, and waves.)
  - "H\u2026ello\u2026"
  mainDialogue:
  - (Boots pulls a math textbook out of his jacket and begins studying it.)
  - (He furrows his brow, as if confused. He must be anxious about his first day
    of high school.)
  - (You remember that the last time he was on the bus, a few high schoolers were
    joking around about how hard high school is.)
  - '(They went on and on about how hard the homework is, how strict the teachers
    are, and that there are tests every day.)

'
  - "(You knew the students weren\u2019t being serious, but it seems like Boots took
    it to heart.)\n"
  - "Hmm\u2026"
  - '(He seems to be stuck on something. He begins to shuffle in his seat anxiously,
    worried about how little he understands.)

'
  - '(He looks at you anxiously, as if contemplating if he should ask you for help
    or not.)

'
  - "U-um\u2026 could you\u2026 help explain this\u2026 please\u2026?"
  - "(You help walk him through the problem he was stuck on. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t
    that complex, so you explained it as you drove.)"
  - "Oh\u2026 I see\u2026 T-thanks\u2026!"
  - (You smile and turn your focus back to the tracks, leaving Boots to continue
    studying.)
  - (Boots shakes his head to regain his concentration, and looks back at the book
    with a renewed determination.)
  - "\u2026"
  - (After a while, you look in the mirror again to check on how his studying has
    been going.)
  - (Only to realize that he has fully fallen asleep, with the book lying open on
    his stomach.)
  - (You choose to let him sleep, but a divet on the tracks jolts him back awake.)
  - (He looks around in surprise, slowly morphing into embarrassment as he covers
    his face with the book, and begins studying.)
  exitDialogue:
  - "Thanks\u2026"
  - (Boots stares at the steps intently as he exits the bus, putting all their effort
    into making sure they do not trip this time.)
  missedStopDialogue:
  - "Oh\u2026 I-"
  - (Boots begins to get up and speak, but then decides against it, and sits back
    down.)
  - (Seems like you missed their stop. You should probably let them off at the next
    one.)
  nextStopDialogue:
  - "Um\u2026"
  - "(Boots stays quiet, but the rustling of his jacket makes you realize they\u2019re
    probably preparing to get off at the next stop)"
