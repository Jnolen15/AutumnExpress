  - "Ah sure am excited for mah new job! Ah do find myself to be quite good at scarecrowin\u2019."

    job at the farm, ah found crows ta be quite friendly!"
  - "Ah ain\u2019t really got much people skills, so ah find talkin\u2019 ta these
    birds ta be much easier!"
  - "And they\u2019re such good listeners!"
  - "Maybe ah can just BEFRIEND the birds! Ah can keep the birds distracted and away
    from the crop by playin\u2019 GAMES with \u2018em!"
  - "Or maybe they can help me patch up my old pair of overalls!... Or maybe even
    help me make NEW \u2018ns!"
  - "Oh, but then ah prolly wouldn\u2019 really be much of a scarecrow now would
    ah!"

    \u2018em!"
  - "Ah\u2019m just more of a FRIENDcrow then a SCAREcrow. Ha ha! Git it?"
  - "(The crows on Straw\u2019s shoulders begin to squawk loudly. It sounds almost
    like they\u2019re\u2026 laughing?)"
  - See? Mike gits it!
  - (Straw and Mike perform a high five.)
  - (Mike squawks again)
  - "Wha- ah already told you ah won\u2019t \u201Clend\u201D you any more of mah
    straw!"
  - (Mike opens their beak in surprise)
  - "You know you never gave back that last piece of straw you \u201Cborrowed\u201D!"
  - "Ava told me that they found it laying in Kai\u2019s nest last saturday!"
  - "(Ava, the bird sitting on Straw\u2019s head, nods in agreement)"
  - (Mike looks down sadly)
  - "What\u2019re you all sad about? There\u2019s gonna be straw ALL AROUND THE FARM!
    Go git some yerself!\r"
  - (Straw seems to have gotten too into their conversation with Mike to continue
    the conversation with you.)
  exitDialogue:
  - (As Straw begins to walk off the bus, a crow on their shoulder turns to you,
    gives you a little squawk and waves a wing at you.)
  - Oh right, Thankee kindly! Hope you have a swell day!
  - Thanks fer remindin' me, little feller.
  missedStopDialogue:
  - "(As you pass a stop by, a crow on Straw\u2019s shoulder begins squawking loudly.)"
  - Oh right, that was mah stop. Ah'll just git off at the next one.
  nextStopDialogue:
  - Ah, that's mah new farm up there!
  - If you can let me off at the next stop that'd be real nice.
